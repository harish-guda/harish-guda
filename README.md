### Namaste :pray:

I am Harish Guda. I am an Assistant Professor with the Department of Supply Chain Management at Arizona State University. 

- :mortar_board: My research interests are broadly at the interface of Economics and Operations and Supply Chain Management. I address incentive and information issues in platforms/marketplaces, where a large number of agents interact. 

- :school_satchel: I also teach courses in Supply Chain Analytics and Operations to full-time MBAs at ASU. 

- :bar_chart: I am a #rstats or `R` user, owing a lot to my prior experience in Supply Chain Analytics. 

- :santa: Life mantra: As the wise economists say, internalize your externalities.
