I am Harish Guda. I am an Assistant Professor with the Department of Supply Chain Management at Arizona State University. 

- :beetle: My research interests are broadly at the interface of Economics and Operations and Supply Chains. I address incentive and information issues in platforms/marketplaces, where a large number of agents interact. 

- :panda_face: I also teach courses in Supply Chain Analytics and Operations to full-time MBAs at ASU. 

- :monkey: I am a #rstats or `R` user, owing a lot to my prior experience with the Supply Chain Analytics group at Nordstrom. 

- :bug: I am currently learning to better work with `tidymodels` better. 

- :snail: I am looking for good case studies to teach supply chain analytics. 

- :penguin: Fun fact: I was once quoted by a local newspaper in a piece about a hoax threat. (Google it). 

- :dog: Pronouns: He/him.
